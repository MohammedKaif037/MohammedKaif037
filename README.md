Software Engineer with 2.5 years of experience designing and building scalable, data-centric systems. I specialize in creating robust data pipelines, optimizing databases for AI-driven applications, and integrating machine learning models into production environments. My goal is to bridge the gap between software engineering and data science to build intelligent, high-performance solutions.

✅ **Building & Optimizing Data Pipelines** for AI/ML workflows
✅ **Database Design & SQL Optimization** for high-volume data processing
✅ **Integrating LLMs & Generative AI** into scalable microservices
✅ **Developing Data APIs & Compliance Layers** for secure analytics
